Setting up testing environment for CellId R package in RStudio
In RStudio, create a new R project and clone the git link https://github.com/RausellLab/CelliD.git

-create a new R file and put the RunMCATesting.R code in it. This is your main file. Everytime RStudio loaded up again, make sure the R project is opened up and must click run button line by line for the lines you need
-replace code in mca.R and cell.R in the RStudio project with the code in this folder's cell.R and mca.R file. (Reason why is because you need to add source() and sourcecpp() func calls for the code to work). If source() or sourcecpp() not working, try opening the files being called so the compiler/system can recognize them
-NOTE: RunMCATesting.R contains code to run the Baron dataset
 
IMPORTANT, for future testing: 
-for any R functions being called that were defined in other R files, must use source("filepath/fileName.R")
-for any c/c++ functions being called in an R file that were defined elsewhere, must use sourceCpp("filepath/filename.c or .cpp")
